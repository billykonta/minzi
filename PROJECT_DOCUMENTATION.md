## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Structure
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- Use React Server Components where appropriate
- Client components should be marked with "use client"
- Organize by feature rather than file type

### State Management
- Use React hooks for component-level state
- Consider Zustand or similar for global state if needed
- Leverage React Context for theme and user preferences

### Styling Approach
- Use Tailwind utility classes as primary styling method
- Create consistent component patterns
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Follow mobile-first responsive design

### AI Integration
- Use streaming responses for chat interface
- Implement proper context management for conversations
- Consider client-side caching for common queries
- Ensure proper error handling for API failures

### Accessibility
- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Ensure proper keyboard navigation
- Use appropriate ARIA attributes
- Test with screen readers

## Getting Started for Developers

1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
   - Git for version control

2. **Clone and Install**:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd mindzi-app
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. **Run Development Server**:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

4. **Key Files and Directories**:
   - `/app`: Next.js app router pages and layouts
